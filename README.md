# Go By Example: A Practical Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository for learning and practicing the Go programming language! <br>
This project serves as a comprehensive collection of my code examples, solutions, and notes as I work through the hands-on tutorials on the [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/) website.

## Purpose & Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to build a strong foundational understanding of Go by doing. 
Instead of just reading about concepts, I'm actively writing and running code for each topic. This approach helps to:

    - Reinforce core concepts through muscle memory.

    - Experiment with syntax and different language features.

    - Create a personal reference library of working code snippets.

    - Track my progress as I advance from basic syntax to more complex patterns like concurrency.

## About the Resource

**[Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/)** is a hands-on introduction to Go using annotated example programs.
Its clean, well-annotated examples make it easy to grasp how different features of the language work.
I highly recommend it as a companion to the official Go documentation.
