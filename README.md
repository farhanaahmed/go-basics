# Go By Example: A Practical Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository for learning and practicing the Go programming language! <br>
This project serves as a comprehensive collection of my code examples, solutions, and notes as I work through the hands-on tutorials on the [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/) website.

## Purpose & Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to build a strong foundational understanding of Go by doing. 
Instead of just reading about concepts, I'm actively writing and running code for each topic. This approach helps to:

    - Reinforce core concepts through muscle memory.

    - Experiment with syntax and different language features.

    - Create a personal reference library of working code snippets.

    - Track my progress as I advance from basic syntax to more complex patterns like concurrency.

## Key Learning Resources

This repository's content is primarily driven by two excellent resources:

1.  **[Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/)** <br>
    An invaluable, hands-on introduction to Go using annotated example programs. This resource guides the repository's file structure, with each topic often getting its own example file (e.g., `variables.go`, `functions.go`).
    
    <br>

2.  **Go in Action (by William Kennedy, Brian Ketelsen, and Erik St. Martin)** <br>
    This book provides a deep dive into the language's core features, focusing on **idiomatic Go** and best practices. Code from this book is used to **supplement** the basic examples, often found in separate, more complex projects or files.
